## Project Overview

Football scoreboard application with an API-Football proxy backend. The project is in early stages with `app.js` as the entry point.

## Architecture

- `app.js` — main application entry point (Node.js)
- The project acts as a proxy to the [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/) service, surfacing football match data to a scoreboard frontend
